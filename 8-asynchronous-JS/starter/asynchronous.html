         * Asynchronous javascript notes
         * - Allows asynchronous functions to run in the background
         * - we pass in callbacks that run once the funcion has finished its work;
         * - Move on immediately; Non-blocking - this means the code will keep on processin in a synchronous way line by line and once the callback is finished it will do it's function
         * 
         * example of another asynchronous piece of code:
         * const image = document.getElementById('img').src;
         * processLargeImage(image, ()=> {
         *  console.log('Image processed!');
         * })
         * 
         * BELOW IS line by line notes of how asynchronous javasript works behind the scenes:
         * 
         *
                const secondAsynch = () => {
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        console.log('two seconds (2000 miliseconds) have passed!!');

                const firstAsynch = () => {
                    console.log('Hey There Asynch');
                    secondAsynch();

                }

                the code above is processed in this way:
                
                EXECUTION STACK

                Global Execution Context

                ////////////// @webAPIs  WEB APIs //////
                - Web APIs live outside the javasctript engine
                - Web APIs houses things such as:
                    - DOM manipulations
                    - setTimout()
                    - http requests
                    - for ajax
                    - Geo locations 
                    - Tons more
                - We have access to things in the Web APIs because they are also in the javascript runtime
                - Web APIs keep track of things such as timers and event listeners. They hold any callback functions until the time has run out or an event has happened. After the time runs out or the event has happened the web api will move the function to the message queue where the function will wait to be executed once the exectution stack is empty
                
                - The Event Loop
                    -- the event loop is resoponsible for ensuring the callback functions in the message queue are exectued.
                    -- It constantly monitors the message queue and the exectuion stack
                    -- It will push the first function in the message queue onto the execution stack as soon as the stack is empty
                    -- event loop will continue pushing any remaining functions in the message queue onto the execution stack until all are processed

         * PROMISE: 
         *  - Object that keeps track of whether a certain event has happened or not; in this case event means and asynchronous event (data coming back from an ajax call, timer finishing);
         *  - Determines what happens after the event has happened;
         *  - Implements the concept of a future value that we're expecting
         * 
         * IN MY OWN WORDS: a promise is a piece of code that says I will go get this piece of information and once I get this data it will be available in this place.
         * 
         * Promises states:
         * - Pending: before the event has happened
         * - Settled/Resolved: once the event has happened
         * - Fulfilled: once the result is availble
         * - Rejected: means there was an error
         * 
         * We can produce and consume promises:
         * Produce - we create a new promise and send the results using that promise
         * Consume - we can callback functions for fullfilment of rejection of the promise
         * 
         * PROMISE OBJECTS can use then() and catch() methods
         *      - then() allows to use an event handler for the case that the promise is fulfilled, then pass a callback function for what to do if the promise was succesful
         *      - catch() allows us to add a handler in case the promise was rejectd and throw an error

     * 
     * For example of below see @consumingPromises
     * - asynchrounous functions are created by adding async before declaring the funcion. Adding the async before hand just means it keeps running in the background.
     * - async functions always return a promise
     * - async await functions can consume one or more promises
     * - await is used inside the async function to assign the promise to a new variable 
     *  - await stops the code from executing until the promise is fulfilled
     *  - if the promise is resolved the value of the promise is then assigned to the variable
     *  - await expression can ONLY BE USED inside an async function
     * 
     * Returning promise from an async function will not work like you would think it works. Primarily becuase by the time that you want to do anyting with the return value from the async function the promise will still be pending so you would see Promise {<pending>} returned instead.
     *

     * AJAX AND APIS
     * 
     * AJAX - ASYNCHROUNOUS JAVASCRIPT AND XML
     * - ALLOWS US TO ASYNCRHRONOUSLY COMMUNICATE WITH REMOTE SERVERS
     * 
     * EXAMPLE - we have an app running in the client(browser) and we want to get data from a server without having to reload entire page. 
     * - send an http request (get,post, etc.) to remote server (API)
     * - server (API) will send the response back
     * - this will happen asynchronously in the background
     * - this also works to send data to the server
     * 
     * API - APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
     * - SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE USED BY ANOTHER PIECE OF SOFTWARE TO ALLOW APPLICATIONS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER
     * 
     * API IN REFERENCE TO AJAX AND WEBDEVELOPMENT 
     * - THE API IS NOT THE SERVER ITSELF BUT A PART OF THE SERVER; LIKE AN APPLICATION THAT RECIEVES REQUESTS AND SENDS BACK RESPONSES.
     * 
     * JAVASCRIPT APIs
     * - build your own API for data coming from your own server
     * - 3rd party APIs
     *
     * 
     * MAKING AJAX CALLS WITH FETCH AND PROMISES
     * 
     * fetch()
     * - fetch will return a promise that we can then consume
     * - when using the fetch method the "endpoint" is the url for what api you want to pull in
     * - once fetch returns the results (response object) you're really only interested in the body which will show as 'readableStream' in the console if logged
     * - readableStream means we first have to process the response; in the case below we have to convert it from JSON to javascript; use the json() method to convert.
     * -json() method returns a promise so you can chain it to the fetch method or anywhere to read the results; it can take sometime so doing it this way will convert it asynchronously in the background
     * 
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     *  Same Origin policy - prevents making ajax requests to domains different than our own domain;
     * 
     * Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - developers of API need to implement this on their own apis;
     * 
     * When the api that you want to use did not implement CORS you can proxy or channel the request through own server
     * 
     * for this example we will use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.co

     * AJAX CALLS WITH FETCH AND ASYNC/AWAIT
     * 
     * making ajax calls with async/await is really easy simply follow the same steps of assigning the results of an await function, function that returns a promise
     * 
     * Catching errors with async await:
     * - cannot use .catch() method
     * - need to use try and catch statements
     * - try: will try and run the code
     * - catch: if error is caugh error will be sent to this block
