************** MODERN JAVASCRIPT ********************
NODE.js and NPM are 3rd party packages where you can find libraries/frameworks and Development tools

NPM - Node package manager, command line interface, and write scripts to automatically set up packages

Babel - converts ES6/ESNext to ES5

    - mac: touch nameFile
- copy file 
    - windows: copy fileNameToCopy folderNameToCopyTo
    - mac: cp fileNameToCopy folderNameToCopyTo
- move file
    - windows: move fileToMove folderToMoveTo
    - mac: mv fileNameToCopy folderNameToCopyTo
- delete a file (REMOVES FROM HARDRIVE)
    - windows: del nameOfFile

    ***********MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER ARCHITECTURE (MVC)****************
    Advantage
    - it decouples the presentation logic with the application logic with a controller in between them which controlls the entire app

    Implementing MVC for forkify
    - Controller 
        > index.js
        > recipe.js
        > List.js
        > likes.js
        - connects Model and View
    - Model > Search.js 
        - ajax calls for search queries
        - data and app logic
    - View 
        > searchView.js
        > recipeView.js
        > listView.js
        > likesView.js
        - get the user input and print the results of search
        - gets and displays data from and to the UI
